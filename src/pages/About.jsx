            Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the
            Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was
            in the area.[25] Amazon went public in May 1997. It began selling
            music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by
            acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany.
            The following year, it began selling music, video games, consumer
            electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and
            toys.[26][27] In 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which
            initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web
            applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004,
            AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web
            crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later
            shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage
            Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in
            2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing
            power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the Fulfillment by
            Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small companies
            (called "third-party sellers") to sell products through Amazon's
            warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33] 2007â€“present: Growth
            Amazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in
            2017.[34] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon introduced a hazard
            pay of $2-per-hour, changes to overtime pay, and a policy of
            unlimited, unpaid time off until April 30, 2020. The hazard pay
            increase expired in June 2020, and the paid time-off policy in May
            2022.[35][36] Amazon also introduced temporary restrictions on the
            sale of non-essential goods, and hired 100,000 more staff in the US
            and Canada.[37] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy
            protested the company's decision to "run normal shifts" despite many
            positive COVID-19 cases.[38][39] In Spain, the company has faced
            legal complaints over its policies.[40] A group of US Senators wrote
            an open letter to Bezos in March 2020, expressing concerns about
            worker safety.[41] On February 2, 2021, Amazon announced that Jeff
            Bezos would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's
            board in Q3 of 2021. Andy Jassy, previously CEO of AWS, became
            Amazon's CEO.[42][43] In January 2023, Amazon announced job cuts for
            over 18,000 workers, in an attempt to cut costs.[44]
